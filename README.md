# Semiparametric_Adaptive_Estimation_of_the_GARCH_Model_Using_Matlab
Semiparametric adaptive estimation of the GARCH model using Matlab

We report Matlab code for semiparametric (adaptive) estimation of the GARCH model; moreover, we report a Monte Carlo simulation which shows that the semiparametric estimator is more efficient than the Quasi Maximum Likelihood estimator. The theory for semiparametric (adaptive) estimation of the GARCH model is reported in Drost and Klaassen (1997), Journal of Econometrics, Volume 81, pp. 193-221. For the sake of brevity, theoretical details on semiparametric estimation are not reported here, and we refer the reader to Drost and Klaassen (1997) for theoretical details. 

OTHER DETAILS: 
All Matlab code files must be included in the same folder, and the folder must be added to Matlab path. The main Matlab file which includes the Monte Carlo simulation is entitled "MainFile.m". All other Matlab files are ancillary files that are used to estimate the parameters of the GARCH model. We use the t5-student innovation for the GARCH process.
